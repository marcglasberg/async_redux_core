## 1.1.3

* Added `ifOpenDialog` and `errorText` to the `UserException`.

## 1.0.5

* On March 5, 2024 I've created this Dart-only package to contain some Dart-only code used by
  the [async_redux](https://pub.dev/packages/async_redux) package. For the moment, this Dart-only
  package simply contains the `UserException`, and nothing more.
