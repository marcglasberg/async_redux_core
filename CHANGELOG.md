## 1.2.1

* Added `ifOpenDialog`, `withDialog` and `errorText` to the `UserException`.

## 1.0.5

* On March 5, 2024, I've created this Dart-only package to contain some Dart-only code used by
  the [async_redux](https://pub.dev/packages/async_redux) package. For the moment, this Dart-only
  package simply contains the `UserException`, and nothing more.
